Make duels. Random duels. Between whatever you want.


This PHP app (using Slim + RedbeanPHP) is the source code for an upcoming website about a collectible card game.

Since almost only the UI part is specific to the game stuff, you can pretty much take the code as a base for any other useless project that involves random duels.
