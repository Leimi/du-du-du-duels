Make duels. Random duels. Between whatever you want.


This PHP app (using Slim + RedbeanPHP) is the source code for an upcoming website about a collectible card game.

Since almost only the UI part is specific to the game stuff, you can pretty much take the code as a base for any project as useless as this one if it involves random duels.

Using composer, grunt and bower: don't forget to install dependencies accordingly with each package manager: `npm install`, `bower install`, `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php` and `php composer.phar install`.
